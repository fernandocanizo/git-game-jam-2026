# Alternativas by ChatGPT

## ToDo

- Buscar el sitio web de cada una de estas y separar entre lo que serían aplicaciones auto-hosteables vs servicios propiamente dichos, como GitHub.

- Verificar que existan y su viabilidad, no recomendar verdura podrida

## Copy&Paste

Let’s spin up a constellation of **GitHub alternatives** — places to host your code, collaborate with teams, or keep everything on your own servers — with a quick note on what makes each one uniquely shiny ✨

---

### **GitLab**

GitLab is the closest all-in-one rival to GitHub. You can use their hosted service *gitlab.com* or self-host an entire DevOps platform. It bundles CI/CD, container registry, issue boards, and permissions right out of the box. Many teams love it for the built-in automation and its strong focus on *private projects* that don’t cost extra.

---

### **Bitbucket (Atlassian)**

Bitbucket is Atlassian’s git hosting, tightly integrated with **Jira** and **Confluence**. It supports both Git and Mercurial (historically). Its big win is that it brings code, issue tracking, and project management together if you’re already deep in Atlassian’s ecosystem. Good for teams that live in Jira and want seamless linking between code and planning.

---

### **Gitea**

Gitea is a lightweight, open-source Git service you can self-host with minimal resources. Think “GitHub clone you can run on a Raspberry Pi.” It has repos, issues, wikis, and basic CI via plugins. If you prize simplicity and low overhead, Gitea is a cozy home for your code without the cloud bill.

---

### **SourceHut**

SourceHut is a minimalist, keyboard-friendly platform focused on speed and transparency. It’s built for developers who prefer mailing-list workflows and plain-text interfaces. It’s modular, meaning you can pick and choose which tools (Git, issues, builds) you need. It’s especially beloved in open source circles that value simplicity.

---

### **Codeberg**

Codeberg is a **non-profit, community-driven** git hosting service built on Gitea. It’s based in Europe and follows strong privacy principles. If you want to support open source infrastructure that’s not driven by big tech and you care about community governance, Codeberg is a great choice.

---

### **AWS CodeCommit**

Amazon’s cloud-native Git hosting integrated into the AWS ecosystem. It scales automatically, supports encryption at rest, and ties smoothly into other AWS services like CodePipeline and IAM for fine-grained access control. Perfect if your entire stack lives inside AWS and you want your git hosting in there too.

---

### **Azure DevOps Repos**

Microsoft’s enterprise-grade Git hosting that sits inside the larger **Azure DevOps** suite. You get repos, boards, pipelines, artifacts, and test plans all linked. If your org uses Microsoft tooling or Azure cloud, this feels like a natural, enterprise-ready home for code and CI/CD.

---

### **Phabricator** *(historical note)*

Phabricator historically offered code hosting, reviews, tasks, and wikis in a unified platform. It was popular with big projects like Meta’s internal tools. Official upstream development ended, but community forks (like *Phorge*) keep the flame alive. It’s great for teams that want an all-in toolchain with deep code review workflows.

---

### **Launchpad**

Canonical’s platform that hosts code (Bazaar and Git), bug tracking, and translations. It’s particularly closely tied to Ubuntu and other open source communities. If you’re building something in that ecosystem or want integrated bug and translation workflows, Launchpad has unique strengths.

---

### **Assembla**

Assembla is geared toward enterprise teams needing secure, high-availability git hosting. It often surfaces in contexts where compliance, legacy systems, or specialized workflows matter. It’s not as shiny-new as GitHub, but it’s focused on reliability and corporate needs.

---

### **NotABug**

A free, community-oriented git hosting based on Gitea with a permissive philosophy. It’s a place where hobbyists and open source folks can host projects without cloud vendor lock-in. Think less corporate polish, more grassroots code garden.

---

### **SourceForge**

One of the original open source hosting sites. It’s less about modern social coding and more about distributing releases, mirroring downloads, and long-term project archives. If your project’s distribution is as important as your source tree, SourceForge still has an audience.

---

### **GitKraken Git Hosting / Glo Boards**

GitKraken offers both GUI tooling and optional hosted repos with integrated issue boards (Glo). This is more of a **tool + hosting combo** — great if you like visually rich boards and syncing with your GitKraken desktop app.
